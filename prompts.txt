I would like a 25 minute yoga flow to stretch.

I would like a yoga practice especially to sooth the low back. Preferably all standing.

I would like a yin yoga practice about 1 hour long, using no props, except maybe one block and/or a bolster. Specifically dedicated to relax the body. But without deep stretching.

I would like a yoga nidra practice. No longer than 30 minutes, but no shorter than 20 minutes.

I would like a yoga flow between 35 and 45 minutes, without downward facing dogs. Focus on heart opening and back bends.

Give me an easy morning yoga flowto energize. No more than 20 minutes. I like the practices of Well with Hels, but an other yoga teacher might be good as well.

I have terrible upper back pain. Can you recommend a yoga practice to combat that? Preferably all low to the ground.

What yoga practice can you recommend to combatting the after lunch dip? Please no more than 15 minutes and all standing.

I am very tired at the moment. I would like to practice some yoga to energize, but not to strenuous. I have about an hour to spare.

Can you give me a yoga practice in which I can practice the yogi squat? Doesn’t have to be a tutorial, preferably a practice with other poses.

I’m very restless. Can you find me a yoga practice to calm down? I prefer some movement in it, I don’t want to ly still most of the time.
